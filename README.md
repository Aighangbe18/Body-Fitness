# Body-Fitness
My Body Fitness App
This is a simple React Native fitness application designed to help users track their progress and manage their workouts. The app features a clean, modern user interface, a streamlined authentication flow, and a modular project structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
🚀 Features
User Authentication: Secure and responsive Login and Sign-up pages.
Intuitive Navigation: A persistent footer for easy access to key sections of the app (Home, Workouts, Profile).
Home Dashboard: A personalized home screen that welcomes the user and displays recent workout progress.
Modular Components: Reusable components like WorkoutCard and a centralized stylesheet (styles.ts) for consistent design.

🎨 Design Choices
The app's design follows a modern and clean aesthetic, prioritizing user experience and readability.
Color Palette: A vibrant green (#4CAF50) is used as the primary accent color to evoke a sense of health and energy.

Layout: The screens are designed to be fully responsive and adapt to different mobile device sizes.
UI Elements: Forms use rounded, filled inputs, and buttons have subtle shadows and gradients for a more interactive and polished look. Icons from lucide-react-native are used for clear visual communication.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js
npm 

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone
cd body-fitness

Install dependencies: The project uses several key libraries. The following command will install all required packages.

npm install

Install additional packages: For the icons and gradients, you will need to install these specific libraries.
npm install lucide-react-native react-native-svg expo-linear-gradient

Start the application:
npx expo start
This will launch the Expo development server, which you can use to run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

🚧 Challenges Faced
Modular Codebase: A primary challenge was structuring the project into separate, logical files to ensure a clean and scalable architecture. The final structure places components, screens, navigation, and styles into dedicated directories.

Dependency Management: Ensuring all third-party libraries, such as expo-linear-gradient and lucide-react-native, were correctly installed and configured was a key step in resolving initial runtime errors.

State Management: The current app uses simple useState hooks for local screen state. A future challenge will be implementing a more robust global state management solution (e.g., React Context or a library like Zustand) for a more complex application.
